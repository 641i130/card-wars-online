# !!! DONE Create a card class
# !!! DONE Create a working card scene
# Use the card scene to make a hand scene and the 3 other scenes to divide things up easily

# Create subclases for each card type spell, building etc
# Give that class the ability to be dragged around and plopped on areas
# Get the scripts to generate the cards and their locations
# Get the graphical aspect generated as well
# Add more logic then focus on the visual aspect last
